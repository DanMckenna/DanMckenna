# Salutations!
My name is Dan Mckenna and I am a Software Engineer <br/>
My goals are to learn more about modern tech, build up my skills, and use my skillset to help others

I have 9 years of team experience in the insurance industry working with a hybrid of modern (C#) and legacy apps (VB6) but am now striving to learn more about the latest and greatest!

Technology that I enjoy working with includes:
- C#
- Python
- MS SQL Server
- JavaScript
